    <td WIDTH="915" link="blue" vlink="blue" alink="#000000"><i>Regarde </i>is a new, easy to
    use curve-sketching (equation grapher) program for IBM compatible computers. It was
    written by a high school student for use by high school students and their teachers. A
    number of schools, TAFEs, maths tutors and high school students have already purchased <i>Regarde
    </i>and site licenses have been bought by Sydney Grammar School and North Sydney College
    of TAFE. <p><i>Regarde </i>can:<ul>
      <li>plot polynomials, trig, absolute value, inverse trig, hyperbolic and log functions in
        the form y=f(x), </li>
      <li>show applications of calculus, work out and plot the derivatives of equations (dy/dx), </li>
      <li>display several graphs on screen at the same time, allowing you to solve equations
        graphically, </li>
      <li>zoom in and out, </li>
      <li>print your graphs, </li>
      <li>save your graphs for later use in other applications. <br>
      </li>
    </ul>

    </center></div><p><i>Regarde </i>has a simple, easy to use interface. Equations can be
    typed directly in with the keyboard or entered using onscreen buttons. You do not need to
    learn any special commands or formats - to plot a hyperbola for example, you just type
    &quot;y=1/x&quot; or use the onscreen buttons. Here is a screen shot showing <i>Regarde's</i>
    interface and the plot sidebar:</p>
    <p>Once you have plotted a graph, you can zoom in and out or centre the axes anywhere on
    the screen. Also, the gradations on the axes can be set to your needs - they can even be
    set to pi. The numbers on the axes and the grid can be turned on and off. Saving or
    printing graphs is simple - it's just a matter of clicking the save or print buttons. <i>Regarde
    </i>can even plot functions such as y=x<sup><font SIZE="-1">x</font></sup>, y=|1/x| and
    y=d/dx( sin<sup><font SIZE="-2">-1</font></sup>(cosx) ) accurately, unlike many other
    plotting programs which join discontinuities. This is due to <i>Regarde's</i> advanced
    plotting engine. Click <a HREF="features.html">here</a> for more details.</p>
    <p>If you are interested in seeing more curves plotted in <i>Regarde </i>or screen shots
    of <i>Regarde's</i> graphical interface, click <a HREF="sshots.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p>A <i>Regarde </i><a HREF="demo.html">demo</a> is available. It allows you to do
    everything that can be done in the registered version (such as plotting curves and their
    derivatives) except print and save graphs. However, it has a 21 day trial period.</p>
    <p>Purchasing <i>Regarde! - Equation Graphing Software </i>is simple. Click <a
