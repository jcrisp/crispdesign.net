<h2>MedAccount</h2>
MedAccount is an ideal accounting package for General Practitioners. It is used by
North Turramurra Medical Practice where it is proving a great success.</p>
<p>It is demonstrated by the following divisions of general practice:
<li>Hornsby Ku-Ring-Gai</li>
<li>Northern Sydney</li>
</P>
<p>
If you are interested in MedAccount and the division near you does not have a demonstration
 version of MedAccount, <a href="../contact.html" target="newwa1">contact me</a> and I will send 
MedAccount to them.
